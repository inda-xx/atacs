      "1. **Conceptual Questions:**\n",
      "   - **Hashmap Explanation:** A hashmap is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs, allowing for fast data retrieval. Hashmaps use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. This differs from arrays or lists, which are indexed by a sequence of integers, making hashmaps more efficient for lookups by non-integer keys.\n",
      "   - **Usefulness in Finance:** Hashmaps are particularly useful in finance because they allow quick retrieval and updating of asset information, which is crucial for real-time data management and decision-making processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Application in Finance:**\n",
      "   - **Real-world Scenarios:**\n",
      "     - **Portfolio Management:** Hashmaps can efficiently track assets by their ticker symbols, allowing for rapid updates and retrievals of asset data.\n",
